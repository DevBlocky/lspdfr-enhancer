# End of LSPDFR Enhancer

Well, I started this journey when I was just first starting out coding. 
Now that I am more advanced, I like to release my code. 
This code has been sitting on my HDD for a while now, and I thought that I should share it with you, to help anyone just learning and starting out how to code.
Object oriented code is very hard, and I didn't get it at first, and now that I am advanced, helping people is my goal. I hope that this V2.0 version can help people in the future.
This isn't really a readme, just a "thank you", to all of the new coders out there, who are just learning, and I hope that all of you have an amazing journey.
